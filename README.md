- [X] **API Endpoints**
  - [X] Application supports the following **Product Endpoints**:
    - [X] `GET /products`: Fetch a list of all products.
    - [X] `GET /products/:id`: Fetch details of a specific product by its ID.
    - [X] `POST /products`: Add a new product to the database.

    - [X] `PUT /orders/:order_id`: Update the details of an existing order (e.g., change status).
    - [X] `DELETE /orders/:order_id`: Remove an order from the database.
    - [X] **VIDEO WALKTHROUGH SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS**: Use Postman or another API testing tool to demonstrate the successful implementation of each endpoint. For the `DELETE` endpoints, please use Prisma Studio to demonstrate that any relevant order items have been deleted. 
- [X] **Frontend Integration**
  - [X] Connect the backend API to the provided frontend interface, ensuring dynamic interaction for product browsing, cart management, and order placement. Adjust the frontend as necessary to work with your API.
  - [X] Ensure the home page displays products contained in the product table.
  - [X] **VIDEO WALKTHROUGH SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS**: Use `npm start` to run your server and display your website in your browser. 
    - [X] Demonstrate that users can successfully add items to their shopping cart, delete items from their shopping cart, and place an order
    - [X] After placing an order use Postman or Prisma Studio demonstrate that a corresponding order has been created in your orders table.

### Stretch Features

- [X] **Added Endpoints**
  - [X] `GET /order-items`: Create an endpoint for fetching all order items in the database.
  - [X] `POST /orders/:order_id/items` Create an endpoint that adds a new order item to an existing order. 
- [ ] **Past Orders Page**

### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes the labs helped a lot, they were able go into more depth and really explain what was needed to be done for most of the steps in the project. What I did feel really unprepared for was the connecting to the frontend, the instructions in both the project and lab were not really helpful and guiding in any direction, the instructors really helped here.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If i had more time, I wouldv'e liked to try implementing the past orders feature, it seems very cool and reasonable feature to add.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I think that overall, in the end, everything went well and I really enjoyed changing up the frontend a little bit to fit my university. I think really getting into the documenttion and understanding how prisma works helped avoid problems later on.

### Open-source libraries used

### Shout out

A huge shoutout to my instructor Keith who helped a lot in guiding me along, and shoutout to Janine, Heiryn, and Jackie for help in understanding what to do.
